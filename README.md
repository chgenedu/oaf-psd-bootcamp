# project_weather_app
This application provides forecasted weather condition information (such as rainfall information and wind speed) for planners of outdoor events. Event planners of outdoor events need to be aware of the weather condition of their venue. Downpours or storms may lead to the need to cancellation of events. This application downloads the weather information for a given location from an online API of a weather service. 

The weather service is specified in the file config/config.json. 
The location is specified by its longitude and latitude, and are stored in the the file location/location.json.

The program will plot the seven-day forecasted weather data, for the precipitation probability, the precipitation (rain + showers + snow), and the wind speed at 10 meters above the ground.
